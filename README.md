# customer-churn-analysis-bank

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the banking sector using Python. Various machine learning models are applied and compared to identify customers who are at risk of leaving the bank. Final customer segments are visualized with Power BI.

## Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- XGBoost Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will churn based on their personal and transactional attributes. Additionally, churn probabilities are used to segment customers and provide business insights.

## Dataset
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle's ** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhuviranga/customer-churn-data/data 
** competition.  It contains detailed information about customer demographics, account features, and churn behavior.


## Final Step: Segmentation & Visualization
These segments are visualized using Power BI for strategic decision-making.
